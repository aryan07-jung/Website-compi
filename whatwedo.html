            <h1>Sustainable Agriculture and Livestock</h1>
            <p><b>
                    Nepal is a developing country with an agricultural economy. The main occupation of Nepal is
                    agriculture. About 80% of people are involved in their occupation. Agriculture is the base of
                    Nepalese people and for Nepal. However, farmers are doing agriculture in the traditional way and
                    using excessive chemicals to increase production. It has been increasing their cost of production
                    and reducing their profit margin. Therefore, LGN intervenes with an integrated approach to convert
                    chemical laden agriculture to environment-friendly sustainable agriculture. Accordingly, the major
                    components are conceived to be sustainable agriculture through IPM and organic-based good
                    agriculture practices. Similarly, we focused on introducing appropriate technology and develop small
                    infrastructure such as poly house construction, irrigation facilities development for the benefit of
                    the farmers. Likewise; marketing promotion and capacity development of the farmers are other parts
                    of this approach. In the same way, LGN intervenes to the farmer on sustainable livestock through
                    good management practices (GMP), fodder management, cattle shed improvement.</b>
           <b>
                LGN aims to increase the productivity of small farmers’ land through is an integrated approach that will
                finally help farmers achieve sustainable livelihood. There is always a question that how to sustain the
                livelihood of the subsistent farmers in the hills. The answer to this is the integrated approach or in
                other words, integrated development. The small farmers’ land should be managed in an integrated way so
                that the per-unit productivity of the land yielded higher. Besides, LGN adopts a strategy of maximum
                utilization of local resources to create alternative means of chemical fertilizer and pesticides by
                using the local people.</b>
